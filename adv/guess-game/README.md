# Guess Game

### Description

```txt
The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt
the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate
whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will
print a congratulatory message and exit.
```

Two versions of the program:

- [Basic version](./guess_game_basic/): Without using custom types.
- [Advanced version](./guess_game_adv/): Using custom types.
